How java changed internet?
--------------------------

1. Java applets
	Java help us to create a program called applet online, and believe me I do not know anything about it.
2. Security
	If you are downloading something from internet, you are at risk. It can be a virus also. Such risks are prevented by java by confining an applet to the java execution environment.
3. Portability
	Have you ever run a C program in linux after running it on windows? You need to first compile it on windows and then run it. Does it sound non-portability. Such portability is ensured in java. 


Bytecode : Magic of Java
------------------------

What is bytecode?

	Have you ever compiled any C program? The output of a C compiler is and executable file. It does not happen in case of Java. The Java compiler compiles a program to its 
	bytecode, which is executed by Java Virtual Machine. If you will compile any java program, you will get a file with .class extension. This is the bytecode of the file.

	The bytecode helps in following aspects:

	1. It makes Java programs portable. You can use JVM and run it.
	2. It makes Java programs secure.

	And do not be worry about Bytecode contents. Just remember, bytecode is input for JVM and output of Java compilers.
