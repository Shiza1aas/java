All computer program consists of two elements:
1. Code
2. Data

Some programs are written around code, i.e., "what is happening" while some others are written around data, i.e., "who is being affected". 
The first approach is called process-oriented approach, while the other is called object oriented approach.


The OOP principles:

1. Abstraction: Whenever we use a car, we do not worry how the internal parts work together. This is called to be abstraction. 

2. Encapsulation: Keeping data and code safe from outside interference is called to be encapsulation. 

3. Inheritence: Have you inherited anything from your ancestors. Inheritence is the property by which one process acquires the property of another.

4. Polymorphism: The feature which allows one interface to be used in various way.


In Java, Polymorphism, Encapsulation, and inheritence work together.
